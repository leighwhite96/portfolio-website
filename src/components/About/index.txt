<p>Welcome to my website! Here's a bit of background about me. After graduating in Maths in early 2017 I found myself a bit lost and unenthused by the idea of applying for countless grad schemes. In the summer I stumbled across the School of Code and I haven't looked back since. </p>


<p>During my time at the School of Code I have found that I enjoy both front and back-end development and going forward want to work in a full-stack role. </p>
<p>In particular I have really enjoyed working with React (I like it so much I decided to build my wesbite uisng it!) and working with MongoDB on the server-side.</p>
<p>I am interested in working collaboratively in an Agile team and in a position where I have the opportunity to develop new skills and learn new technologies. </p>
